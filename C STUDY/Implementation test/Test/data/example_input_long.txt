romeo  nay thats not so mercutio  i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain light lights by day take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits romeo  and we mean well in going to this masque but tis no wit to go mercutio  why may one ask romeo  i dreamt a dream tonight mercutio  and so did i romeo  well what was yours mercutio  that dreamers often lie romeo  in bed asleep while they do dream things true mercutio  o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomi over mens noses as they lie asleep her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers her traces of the smallest spider web her collars of the moonshines watry beams her whip of crickets bone the lash of film her wagoner a small graycoated gnat not half so big as a round little worm pricked from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love on courtiers knees that dream on cursies straight oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail tickling a parsons nose as he lies asleep then he dreams of another benefice sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths five fathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she romeo  peace peace mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing mercutio  true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who woos even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angered puffs away from thence turning his side to the dewdropping south benvolio  this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late romeo  i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet

murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemnèd and myself excused prince  then say at once what thou dost know in this friar lawrence  i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeos faithful wife i married them and their stoln marriage day was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death banished the newmade bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothed and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave being the time the potions force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayed by accident and yesternight returned my letter back then all alone at the prefixèd hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindreds vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awakening here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigor of severest law prince  we still have known thee for a holy man wheres romeos man what can he say to this balthasar  i brought my master news of juliets death and then in post he
